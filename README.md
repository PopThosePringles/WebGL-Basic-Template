A very basic template that I wrote for myself when playing around with WebGL stuff.

Thought I would share it here for others that don't want to go through all the setting up.

- Added quad example that sends data to the vertex and fragment shader as an example.
- Included example of sending time to the fragment shader so you can animate stuff.
- Created a very basic fragment shader that is animated.
